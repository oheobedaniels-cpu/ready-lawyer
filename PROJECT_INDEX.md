- `contributeNative(bytes32 id)` / `contributeERC20(bytes32 id, uint256 amount)`
- `finalize(bytes32 id)` - Determine campaign outcome
- `claimRefund(bytes32 id)` - Contributors claim refunds for failed campaigns

**Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, AccessControl, SafeERC20

#### 5. ReadyListings.sol
**Purpose**: Lawyer marketplace and case signal system
**Key Features**:
- Lawyer profile listings with hourly rates and tags
- Client case signals for lawyer discovery
- Minimal on-chain storage with event-based indexing
- Budget range specifications for case matching

**Main Functions**:
- `upsertLawyerListing(string profileURI, uint256 hourlyRate, string[] tags)`
- `createCaseSignal(bytes32 signalId, string caseURI, uint256 budgetMin, uint256 budgetMax, string[] tags)`
- `removeLawyerListing()` - Lawyers can remove their listings
- `closeCaseSignal(bytes32 signalId)` - Close case signals

**Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin AccessControl, Pausable, ILegalPractitionerRegistry
